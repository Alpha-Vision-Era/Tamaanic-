# Tamaanic — طمانک  
**Symbol of Wellness | A Healing Method by Syed Waleed Mehboob Ali**

Tamaanic is a metaphysical healing method developed under the *Center of Divine Architecture Studies (CODAS)*. Derived from the word **"طمانیت" (Tamaniyat)**, Tamaanic refers to a unique state of inner peace and alignment. It offers a non-verbal, energetic approach to wellness through the alignment of heart, mind, and perception.

---

## Core Concept

Tamaanic explores the unseen architecture of thought and emotion using subtle influence, intuitive mapping, and spiritual cognition. It does **not rely on hypnosis, talk therapy, or traditional healing methods**. Instead, it utilizes **heart mind alignment** and **silent perceptual intervention** to clear inner blockages.
